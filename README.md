# C++ Learning Repository - 42 School

**C++ Learning Projects**  
A series of progressively challenging C++ tasks from CPP_00 to CPP_09, covering fundamental to advanced C++ concepts. Developed as part of the 42 School curriculum.

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of small C++ projects, each focusing on different aspects of the language, with complexity increasing from CPP_00 to CPP_09. It serves as a progressive learning experience to gain proficiency in C++, aligned with the 42 School curriculum.

Each project introduces new concepts, allowing for incremental learning and mastery of C++ functionalities such as classes, inheritance, templates, and more.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into directories, each representing a different project or set of tasks with a specific focus. Each module builds upon the previous one, introducing new C++ concepts and practices:

- **CPP_00**: *Namespaces, classes, member functions, stdio streams, initialization lists, static, const, and some other basic stuff*

- **CPP_01**: *Memory allocation, pointers to members, references, switch statement*

- **CPP_02**: *Ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading and Orthodox Canonical class form*

- **CPP_03**: *Inheritence*

- **CPP_04**: *Subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, interfaces*
  
- **CPP_05**: *Repetition and Exceptions*
  
- **CPP_06**: *C++ casts*
  
- **CPP_07**: *C++ templates*
  
- **CPP_08**: *Templated containers, iterators, algorithms*

- **CPP_09**: *C++ Standard Template Library (STL)*
